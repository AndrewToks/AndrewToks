I am a passionate frontend developer with expertise in crafting dynamic and visually appealing web applications using Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS.
I specialize in creating seamless user experiences, leveraging Reactâ€™s component-based architecture for efficient and reusable code. With Next.js, I build high-performance, SEO-friendly applications, focusing on server-side rendering and static site generation. 
TailwindCSS enables me to deliver modern, responsive designs with consistent styling and rapid development. 
Additionally, I have started learning React Native for app development, aiming to expand my skills to mobile platforms. My goal is to build intuitive, scalable solutions that align with user and business needs.
